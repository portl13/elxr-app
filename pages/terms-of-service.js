            <p>
              ELXR is an Community Engagement Platform that enables creators to
              be paid by their supporters. One of our foundational principles is
              to provide equitable revenue to creators for their content, and
              these terms aim to do that.
            </p>

            <h3>All about being a creator</h3>
            <p>
              A creator is someone who creates an Community Engagement Platform
              on ELXR to interact with members who have purchased subscriptions,
              tickets and courses to support the creator. There are a lot of
              details below involving payments, fees, taxes and restrictions
              that you should read in full if you are a creator.
            </p>
            <h3>Membership</h3>
            <p>
              To become a creator, simply launch your page to start your
              Community Engagement Platform. When you join ELXR, you become part
              of the ELXR community. You can use creator tools that ELXR
              providesto showcase your creations, sell merchandise to
              subscribers through ELXR’s Store System, and to receive recurring
              revenue from your page. Subscriptions are for your most passionate
              fans. On ELXR, you can provide your subscribers something exciting
              that gives them unique benefits they want, like additional access,
              merchandise, exclusivity, and engaging experiences. In turn, you
              will receive loyal support from your subscribers, and recurring
              revenue from subscriptions that members have purchased from you
              through ELXR.
            </p>
            <h3>Payments</h3>
            <p>
              As a creator you make your Community Engagement Platform available
              on ELXR, and we provide subscription payments processing to your
              followers on a recurring basis, and individually processed event
              and course payments. We also handle payments issues such as fraud,
              chargebacks and resolution of payments disputes. We try to provide
              timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience
              delays in accessing your funds. We may also block or hold payments
              for violations of our policies or for compliance reasons,
              including collecting tax reporting information. When payments are
              delayed or blocked, we try to communicate the reason to you
              promptly. If you have questions about a payments block, please
              reach out to us. In order to protect creators, we may block
              subscribers’ payments if we believe them to be fraudulent.
              Sometimes activities like refunds can put your account balance
              into the negative. If your balance becomes negative then we
              reserve the right to recover those funds from future payments.
            </p>
            <h3>Fees</h3>
            <p>
              ELXR does not charge any monthly fee to our creators. Our revenue
              structure is based on a 75/25 percent split of revenue, with 75%
              going to the creator and 25% to the platform. ELXR incurs
              significant expense by providing a complete media management
              studio service, including native live streams, video on demand,
              podcasting, blogs, image management and more. To provide these in
              depth services ELXR provides a risk free service to our creators
              as they grow their subscriber base.
            </p>
            <h3>Tax</h3>
            <p>
              We collect tax identification information and report this to tax
              authorities as legally required. You are responsible for reporting
              any income or withholding taxes which may be due as a result of
              payments received. We are additionally responsible for a number of
              transactional taxes across the world. These include but are not
              limited to VAT on payments for electronically supplied services to
              subscribers in the EU, GST as an operator of an electronic
              distribution platform (EDP) within Australia, and state sales tax
              as a result of ‘marketplace laws’ within the United States. For
              the purpose of electronically-supplied services, creators make a
              supply of those services to us, and then we supply them to the
              subscriber. Applicable tax will not be taken from a subscription,
              but rather will be charged in addition to the subscription. Once
              settled, the tax amount will be automatically deducted for
              remittance to the applicable taxing authority. A record of the
              transaction tax portion of the pledge will be available on your
              earnings details page. As a creator on our site, it is your
              responsibility to provide accurate information when you are
              engaging with the sales tax weighting tool and, generally, when
              listing benefits transferred within your subscription.
            </p>
            <h3>Restrictions</h3>
            <p>
              We don’t allow creations and benefits that violate our policies.
              You can learn more by visiting our Community Guidelines and
              Benefit Guidelines. A summary of those rules is that we don’t
              allow:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Illegal creations or benefits.</li>
              <li>
                Creations or benefits that are abusive towards other people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creations or benefits that use others’ intellectual property,
                unless you have written permission to use it, or your use is
                protected by fair use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creations or benefits with real people engaging in sexual acts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If your fans include people under the age of 18, then please
              remind them that they need permission to join your membership, and
              those under the age of 13 cannot use ELXR. We are not required to
              allow any particular person or group of persons to be your
              subscriber.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a creator you are also responsible for keeping subscriber data
              safe. You can see what is required in our Data Processing
              Agreement. An account is tied to your creative output and cannot
              be sold or transferred for use by another creator.
            </p>
            <h3>All about being a ELXR Member</h3>
            <p>
              As a member, you’re joining ELXR to be part of an exciting
              movement to support a creator’s subscription, events and courses,
              while you get special benefits, which may include access to your
              creator, merchandise (when offered), exclusivity, and engaging
              experiences with the creator and subscriber community. In
              exchange, you pay ELXR for subscription programs, on a recurring
              basis, to access and support creators you like.
            </p>
            <p>
              The timing and amount of each subscription depends on the type of
              agreement you enter into, and the creator you support. You can see
              the details as you join, as well as in the receipt sent to you
              after each successful payment. You can view all your active
              membership subscriptions and billing history on your membership
              page.
            </p>
            <p>
              To become a subscriber, simply create an account, add your
              preferred payment method, and purchase a subscription to start
              supporting your favorite creator.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may cancel your payments at any time. Terminating or lowering
              the tier support of subscription will go into effect in the
              subsequent (not current) payment term. This includes when you
              cancel your membership subscription, your payment method fails,
              the creator blocks you, or the creator deletes their account. We
              are not required to allow you to be a subscriber of any particular
              creator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creators’ subscriptions vary and we have limited control over the
              quality and specific offerings. We attempt to screen for
              fraudulent creator pages, but cannot guarantee the identity of
              creators or the validity of any claims they make. We appreciate
              your help reporting suspicious creator pages so we can keep ELXR
              safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are located in the jurisdiction in which ELXR is required
              to charge and collect tax (e.g. VAT or, sales tax), then this tax
              is added to the total charge. Except in limited circumstances,
              this tax is shown when you set up the initial membership
              subscription. ELXR remits all tax collected to the applicable
              taxing authority. As tax is largely dependent on your location.
              You are responsible for keeping your address complete and up to
              date.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a foreign
              transaction fee for your subscription. ELXR does not control this
              charge, but it is typically around 3%. Please contact your bank
              for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refunds. Our policy is No Refunds, though we will allow for some
              exceptions where refunds are granted at our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <h3>ELXR's role</h3>
            <p>
              We proactively look at some pages and posts on ELXR to make sure
              creators follow our Community Guidelines and Benefit Guidelines.
              We also investigate reports of potential violations. These
              investigations may take a while to resolve and may include looking
              at what is supported by funds received through ELXR.
            </p>
            <p>
              In most situations, we will work with creators to resolve any
              potential violations and allow the creator to continue using ELXR.
              Terminating accounts is not an action we take lightly and is done
              in only the most extreme cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please let us know if you see potential violations of our
              Community Guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a global company based in the United States with operations in
              other countries, we must comply with economic sanctions and trade
              restrictions, including those implemented by the Office of Foreign
              Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
              This means that ELXR cannot take part in transactions that involve
              designated people, places, or items that originate from those
              places, as determined by agencies like OFAC.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are constantly testing out new features with the goal of making
              ELXR better. We may add or remove features, and often test
              features with a random subset of our community. If we believe a
              feature is significantly different from these terms, we will
              explain those differences in the test.
            </p>

            <p>

              our My Account. From your account page you can set your privacy
              settings, download a full copy of your ELXR data, and delete your
              account entirely.

            <p>
              You keep full ownership of all creations that you offer on ELXR,
              but we need licenses from you to operate ELXR effectively. By

              infringe on others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights.
              We may ask you for consent verification for collaborators depicted
              in content funded through ELXR. Subscribers may not use creations
              posted by creators in any way not authorized by the creator.
            </p>

              These terms and any referenced policies are the entire agreement
              between you and us, and supersede all prior agreements. If any
              provision of these terms is held to be unenforceable, then that
              provision is modified to the extent necessary to enforce it. If a
              provision cannot be modified, it is severed from these terms, and
              all other provisions remain in force. If either party fails to
              enforce a right provided by these terms, it does not waive the
              ability to enforce any rights in the future. We may sometimes make
              changes to these terms and policies. If we make material changes
              that adversely affect your rights, then we will let you know
              before the changes come into effect. Continuing to use ELXR after
              a change means you accept the new terms or policies. These terms
              are an agreement with ELXR, Inc., 72 West Broadway Suite 202,
              Eugene, OR 97405.
