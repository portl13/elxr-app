This is why in the Paleolithic diet, foods that would readily be available to our ancestors are acceptable. This includes meat, fruit and vegetables. Food such as grain and dairy products are prohibited. In various studies done, it was found that individuals who followed the Paleolithic diet had decreased waist circumference, improved glucose sensitivity, improved HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, lipid profile, weight and waist circumference, and no statistically significant change in C-reactive protein (CRP).",

When there is less carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts the fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies to use for energy supply. The ketone bodies are used by the brain, replacing glucose as an energy source.",
